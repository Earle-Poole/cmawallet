			your every movement. If you are carrying a regular concealed weapon, the likelihood that you will be 
			able to get 20 feet of distance, get them heavily distracted or move with lightning speed to draw 
			your weapon and protect yourself is highly unlikely. There is a good chance that even if you gave 
			them a wallet, your life could still be in jeopardy.`}

			pocket, but it allows you to be in close proximity to the threat to allow you to draw your weapon.  
			Additionally, they do not need to be distracted and you can comply with their demands of moving slowly.  
			For them, and unknowingly to them, the slower you move the better it is for you.  It wont appear that 
			you are going for a weapon, when the holster and weapon are slowly drawn out to allow you to discharge 
			the weapon, they will have it in their mind that you are giving them a wallet, but instead you are 
			throwing them a Curveball.`}
